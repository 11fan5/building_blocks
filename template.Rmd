I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r }
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.




# Learning Assessment 

This is code for the learning assessment at P8105
```{r la_chunk}
la_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 1),
    norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
    abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm_samp)) + geom_histogram()

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```


The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.
